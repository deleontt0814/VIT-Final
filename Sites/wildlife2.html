    <!-- Description-->
    <p>
        Sea otters are members of the weasel or mustelid family. Like other members of this family,
        </br>
        they have very thick fur. In fact, at 850,000 to one million hairs per square inch, they have the
        </br>
        thickest fur of any mammal. Their fur actually consists of two layers, an undercoat and longer guard hairs.
        </br>
        This system traps a layer of air next to their skin so their skin does not get wet. Sea otters are usually dark
        brown,
        </br>often with lighter guard hairs. Alaskan sea otters tend to have lighter fur on their heads.
